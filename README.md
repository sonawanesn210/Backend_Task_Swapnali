What is MQTT Protocol?

MQTT stands for Message Queuing Telemetry Transport,  MQTT is a simple messaging protocol, designed for constrained devices with low bandwidth. So, itâ€™s the perfect solution to exchange data between multiple IoT devices.

MQTT communication works as a publish and subscribe system. Devices publish messages on a specific topic. All devices that are subscribed to that topic receive the message.

MQTT Publish Subscribe
Its main applications include sending messages to control outputs, read and publish data from sensor nodes and much more.
